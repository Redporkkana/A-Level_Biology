        "options": [
            "Oxygen transport will be less efficient due to a reduced surface area for diffusion",
            "Oxygen transport will be more efficient as the spherical shape allows for greater hemoglobin storage",
            "There will be no change in oxygen transport since all red blood cells contain the same amount of hemoglobin",
